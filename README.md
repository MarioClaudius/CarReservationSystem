# CarReservationSystem
This is a Car Reservation System with UI.

There are 2 types of user in this project
- Host = this user can update the data, change password, and checking the list of transaction. 
         If the program is executed for the first time, the program will request the password to the first user (assuming the first user is the host).
         The user need to input the password again to login as a host.
- Consumer = this user can check the list of car that can be reserved, reserve a car that available, check the ticket, and return the car to pay for it.
             User doesn't need a password to login as consumer. The user can't check the ticket once he/she logout.
             
All of data in this program/project is hard coded.
